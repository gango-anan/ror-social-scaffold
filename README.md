# STAY IN TOUCH

Stay In Touch is a revamped social media application created using Ruby on rails on top of a project that was already existing. This application allows friends to keep in touch by creating accounts, inviting other registered users to a friendship and communicate to each other through posts. Below is a screenshot of the home page of a signed in user.
